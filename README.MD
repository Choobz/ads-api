# Disclaimer on requirements

Since no technical requirements except on language was expressed in the exercise, 
the contributor assumes infinite memory, CPU and client timeouts :)

List of requirements I would ask clarification on :

* What's the expected income on that feature ?
* What is the time to market expected ?
* What kind of client the API is supposed to serve ? Internal (IT, business ?) ? External ?
* "considering that the dataset will contain a large number of entries.". What
does a large number mean ? At what due date is it gonna be large ? Does it grow infinitely ? Exponentially ?
How many concurrent access are we expecting ?
* What are the infrastructure requirements ? Most infrastructures cannot accommodate for every machine/tooling (some will even accommodate just one kind)
* What kind of SLA are expected ? Both uptime and latency ?
